Mdinv 3D Viewer
================================================================================



Mdinv 3D Viewer
----------------------------------------

Mdinv 3D Viewer is a 3D mesh viewer for irrlicht and nirtcpp mesh formats. It will help you develop 3D applications using irrlicht or nirtcpp. I write it because I need such a tool to quickly check and look the 3d mesh immediately before I write the code. So I am the man who needs it. And you can use it too if you want.



The Name MDINV
----------------------------------------

The MD come from md2 and md3 mesh format. The I comes from irrlicht, the N comes from nirtcpp, and the V comes from viewer. The name is not so important, as it is just a mark.
